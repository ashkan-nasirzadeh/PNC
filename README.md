programming naming convention

you want to choose a name for a column in a user_table in a database? sometimes you use `fname` but sometimes `firstName` or  `fn` or what! I want to be solid in these kinds of issues so actually we need a convention for most common names that we frequently use in variables, functions, classes, project directories and even for naming a column in a table of a database

here I want (I wish) to write down this convention with the aid of the programmers in all over the world

## general rules

## project directories

## variables

## database columns
